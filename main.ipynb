    "1. Explain the different types of data (qualitative and quantitative) and provide examples of each. Discuss nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tQualitative Data: Descriptive data that categorizes or labels (e.g., colors, gender).</br>\n",
    "\t•\tNominal Scale: Data with categories having no order (e.g., colors: red, blue, green).</br>\n",
    "\t•\tOrdinal Scale: Data with categories that can be ordered but no meaningful difference (e.g., movie ratings: 1 star, 2 stars, etc.).</br>\n",
    "\t•\tQuantitative Data: Numerical data representing quantities (e.g., height, weight).</br>\n",
    "\t•\tInterval Scale: Data with ordered values and meaningful differences, but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).</br>\n",
    "\t•\tRatio Scale: Data with a true zero and meaningful ratios (e.g., weight, height).</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "2. What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each?</br>\n",
    "\t•\tMean: Average of the data, used when there are no extreme outliers.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tMedian: Middle value, used when data has outliers or skewness.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tMode: Most frequently occurring value, used for categorical data or finding the most common value in a dataset.</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "3. Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?</br>\n",
    "\t•\tDispersion: Refers to the spread of data values around a central value.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tVariance: Measures the average squared deviation from the mean.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tStandard Deviation: Square root of variance, represents average deviation from the mean in original units.</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "4. What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?</br>\n",
    "\t•\tA box plot visualizes the data’s spread and highlights the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tIt shows:</br>\n",
    "\t•\tCentral value (median),</br>\n",
    "\t•\tSpread (interquartile range, or IQR),</br>\n",
    "\t•\tExtreme values (outliers).</br>\n",

    "5. Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tRandom sampling ensures every member of a population has an equal chance of selection.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tIt reduces bias and allows inferences about the population with known probabilities, enabling statistical analysis and generalizations.</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?</br>\n",
    "\t•\tSkewness: Measures asymmetry in a dataset.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tPositive Skew: Tail on the right; mean > median.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tNegative Skew: Tail on the left; mean < median.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tSkewness affects central tendency: in skewed data, the median is preferred over the mean.</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "7. What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?</br>\n",
    "\t•\tIQR: Difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and 25th percentile (Q1).</br>\n",
    "\t•\tOutliers: Data points are outside[Q1-1.5*IQR,Q3+1.5*IQR].</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "8. Discuss the conditions under which the binomial distribution is used.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tConditions:</br>\n",

    "\t3.\tProbability of success is constant.</br>\n",
    "\t4.\tTrials are independent.</br>\n",
    "\t•\tExample: Flipping a coin 10 times to count the heads.</br>\n",

    "Real-life example of a Poisson process:</br>\n",
    "Suppose a customer service center receives, on average, 5 calls per hour. This is a Poisson process since:</br>\n",
    "\t1.\tThe calls occur independently. </br>\n",

    "\t•\tFind the probability by using the following:</br>\n",
    "\t•\tRaise the average rate (5) to the power of the desired number of calls (3).</br>\n",
    "\t•\tMultiply by the natural exponent (e, approximately 2.718) raised to the negative of the average rate (-5).</br>\n",
    "\t•\tDivide by the factorial of the desired number of calls (3 factorial = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6).</br>\n",
